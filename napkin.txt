designing open systems,
instead of static objects,
undermines the authority of the architect in architecture.

the last word on [ design ]
no longer belongs to [ the designer ]

if we design patterns and parameters for space,
the designed product is a debate, not an imposition.
so language becomes critical:

“I” can’t articulate my concept of [ domestic mutations ]
but “I” can still make a [ home ]

automation is the tool for persistent translation.
participation, subversive or passive, shapes environment,
so why limit creation to the architect?
we can be diplomats instead of dictators.

short version: the goal is to weaponize minecraft
